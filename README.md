# Projects in Data Analytics for Decision Making 2019-2020
This project was done in the context of the course of project in Data analytics for Decision Making. 

The goal was to detect process that would fail, and to attempt to the identify the roots of failure. This was performed thanks to machine learning techniques. All the details may be found in the Report section.

The first part of the project was dedicated to data description and data cleaning. To perform a variable selection algorithms such as the Boruta were used. Moreover due to the small amount of data, an multiple imputation was performed to replace missing values. 

The second and final part of this project was dedicated to apply machine learning models on the dataset to see what was causing the issue on the process.
